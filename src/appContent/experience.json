Here I work in new developments and code maintenance, this includes: 1- Data Base (modify and create tables, modify and create SQL views, write complex SQL queries) 2- Back End (modify and create Node-Express endpoints, creation of complex controllers that process a lot of information) 3- Front End (We don't have UI/UX designers so this includes not only the development but also the design of new functionalities, and even sometimes meetings with clients)."
